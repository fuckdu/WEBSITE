                        <p><br>1/2 cup plain yoghurt , full fat
                            <br>
                            <br>1 piece onion minced
                            <br>1 tbsp lemon juice
                            <br>1 tsp tumeric powder
                            <br>2 tsp garam masala (Note 1)
                            <br>1/2 tsp chilli powder or cayenne pepper powder (Note 2)
                            <br>1 tsp ground cumin
                            <br>1 tbsp ginger, freshly grated 
                            <br>2 cloves garlic, crushed
                            <br>1.5 lb / 750 g chicken thigh fillets, cut into bite size pieces
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br> Optional blitz: for an extra smooth sauce, combine the Marinade ingredients (except the chicken) in a food processor and blend until smooth. (I do not do this)
                            <br>Marinade: Combine the Marinade ingredients with the chicken in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or up to 24 hours (minimum 3 hrs).
                            <br>Cook chicken: Heat the ghee (butter or oil) over high heat in a large fry pan. Take the chicken out of the Marinade but do not wipe or shake off the marinade from the chicken (but don’t pour the Marinade left in the bowl into the fry pan). 
                            <br>Place chicken in the fry pan and cook for around 3 minutes, or until the chicken is white all over (it doesn’t really brown because of the Marinade).
                            <br>Sauce: Add the tomato passata, cream, sugar and salt. Also add any remaining marinade left in the bowl. Turn down to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Do a taste test to see if it needs more salt.
                            <br> Garnish with coriander/cilantro leaves if using. Serve with basmati rice.
                            <br> The Butter Chicken is pictured with my very easy No Yeast Flatbread and no-fry papadums (Note 5).</p>

                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p>
                            <h3>Marinate Chicken</h3>
                            
                                Make the marinade by mixing yogurt, ginger, garlic, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, salt, mint leaves, and lemon juice.
                                Add chicken and coat evenly with the marinade. Keep in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Note: You can also marinate the chicken overnight in teh refrigerator.
                                Soak saffron in warm milk, reserve.
                            
                                <h3> Rinse & Soak Rice</h3> 
                            
                                Rinse and drain the basmati rice 2 to 3 times. Add 4 cups of water and let it soak for 20 minutes. 
                            
                                <h3>Fry Onions</h3> 
                            
                                While the rice is soaking, add ghee to a heavy-bottomed pan and add onions. On medium heat, fry the onions stirring frequently until they become light golden brown and start to crisp up - about 15 to 20 minutes.
                                Remove the fried onions from the pan, leaving the excess ghee behind as we will use this pan to cook the chicken. Add one fourth of the fried onions to the marinated chicken and give a quick mix. 
                            
                                <h3>Parboil Rice</h3>
                            
                                In a medium pot add 8 cups of water. Add cumin seeds, bay leaves, star anise, cardamom, cloves, and salt to the rice and bring it to boil on high heat.
                                Drain the soaked rice and add it to the boiling water. Bring the rice to a full boil on high heat. Lower the heat to medium and cook uncovered for 5 to 6 minutes or until the rice is about 90% cooked. Drain the rice promptly and reserve.
                            
                                <h3>Cook chicken</h3>
                            
                                To the pan with the remaining ghee, add the marinated chicken. Cook on medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, turning halfway through.
                            
                                <h3>Layer and cook Biryani on Dum</h3>
                            
                                Carefully layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken. Top with caramelized onions and saffron-infused milk.
                                Cover the pot and seal it with aluminum foil, then place some weight over the lid. Cook on low heat for 20 minutes, this is the steam or "Dum" cooking step. Turn the heat off and wait another 10 minutes before opening the pot.
                                Garnish with cilantro. Before serving allow the biryani to sit uncovered for 5 minutes. Gently fluff the rice using a fork or a silicone spatula. This will help the delicate rice grains to firm up a bit preventing them from breaking. Serve with Raita and lemon wedges.

                          <br> 3. Close the Instant Pot with pressure valve to sealing. Select Pressure Cook(Hi) and adjust the pressure cook time to 5 minutes.
                          <br> 4. Allow 5 minutes of natural pressure release and then release the remaining pressure manually. Open the Instant Pot and carefully take out the rice bowl and the trivet.

                            <br> ½ cup rolled oats quick oats will work too
                            <br> ½ cup urad dal
                            <br> ¼ cup chana dal
                            <br> 1½ cups water for making the batter
                            <br> 1½ teaspoons kosher salt
                            <br> ¼ cup oil or ghee to apply to the cooked dosa 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1.  Rinse the quinoa, oats & lentils. Drain out the water and then soak with 3 cups of water for 4 hours.
                            <br>2. Drain out all the water. Add to a blender and blend with water. The dosa batter consistency will be like pancake batter. Add salt and mix well
                            <br>3. Allow to rest for 20 minutes or an hour or start making the dosa’s right away
                            <br>4. Preheat a nonstick griddle on low heat. Pour about ⅓ cup of batter and spread it into a thin dosa using the back of the ladle or a measuring cup. Starting from the middle spread the batter in a circular motion going outwards.
                            <br>5. Once the bottom of the dosa starts to turn golden brown, evenly spread a little bit of oil or ghee on the dosa. Allow the dosa to crisp up further for another couple of minutes or if you like softer dosa lower the heat and take the dosa out.
                            <br>6. Using a flat spatula start remove the dosa from the outer edges, then gently fold the dosa and serve immediately with coconut chutney and spicy potatoes.
                            <br>7. Before making the next dosa, lower the heat and wipe the pan using wet paper towels. You can also cut an onion in half and use the flat portion of the onion to rub on the pan. This helps cool down the pan a bit and will allow you to spread the batter thinly and evenly.
                            <br>8. Repeat making dosa with the rest of the batter. Any remaining batter can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.</p>

                           <br>  ½ tbsp Ghee/Clarifed Butter
                           <br>  ½ cup Granulated white sugar
                           <br>  2 Cardamom pods
                           <br>  2 sticks Cinnamon
                           <br>  2 Bayleaves 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. These are the ingredients I used but you can adjust the sugar to your choice.
                           <br>  2.  In a non stick pan, add 1/2 tablespoon of ghee. 
                           <br>  3.  If you don't have ghee, you can also make this with butter.
                            <br> 4.  Break the strands of vermicelli in half and add it to the ghee. 
                           <br>  5.  Fry this on medium-low heat by stirring. Be careful to not burn it.
                           <br>  6.  Once all the strands are lightly fried evenly, take it out the pot and place in a bowl. Keep this aside.
                           <br>  7.  You will make the dessert in the same pot now.
                           <br>  8.  Add in 4 & 1/2 cups of milk- I used measuring cups. If you don't have any measuring cups, then use a standard tea mug as the measurement is very similar
                           <br>  9.  Add in the whole spices as this gives the dish a nice aroma.
                          <br>   10. Put the gas up and bring this to boiling point- keep an eye, otherwise you'll have a big mess to clear! Once it comes to boiling point, put the gas down and let this boil for 5-6 minutes on low heat. 
                           <br>  11. Add in the sugar after 5-6 minutes.
                          <br>   mix the sugar in and cook this for a good few minutes so the sugar melts. Sugar can be adjusted to your taste so you can taste and add more if you like.
                           <br>  Add in the fried vermicelli.
                           <br>  Slightly put the gas up and mix this in. Cook on medium-low heat. Adjust heat if required and keep an eye.
                           <br>  Cook for 5-6 minutes and then turn the heat off. 
                            <h3>All done!</h3>

                        <p class="meal-descript-about">Chicken Kosha is an age-old Bengali way of cooking Chicken. Like Kosha Mangsho this one is also high on spice level and not for faint-hearted. 😉 The word Kosha (a Bengali word) means dryish or a gravy which is quite dry in consistency. It’s a popular dish; every Bengali family cooks it in their own way, so, the recipe may vary a little bit from home to home. I’m sharing my version here.

                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>

                            <br>1. Clean chicken chunks and pat-dry those.
                            <br> 2. Now make a paste of 2 Onions.
                            <br> 3. Marinade Chicken with Onion paste, half of the Ginger and garlic paste, and half of Turmeric Powder, Red Chili powder, Cumin powder, Coriander powder, sugar, and salt.
                            <br> 4. Add 1 Tbsp. Mustard oil and 100g Yogurt/ Curd to the marinade as well.
                            <br> 5. Mix properly.
                            <br> 6. Keep the chicken in the refrigerator for at least four hours.
                            <br> 7. While cooking roughly chop the remaining onion.
                            <br> 8. Heat 4 Tbsp. Mustard Oil in a deep bottom pan.
                            <br> 9. emper the oil with Bay leaf, Dry Red Chilli, Black and green cardamom, and also with Cinnamon stick.
                            <br> 10. While the tempering emits an aroma add the remaining sugar and let it caramelize.
                            <br> 11. Now add chopped onion and fry till it turns light pink.
                            <br> 12. Do not over-fry onion else the gravy will turn bitter.
                            <br> 13. Once fried, add remaining ginger and garlic paste and fry for a minute.
                            <br> 14. Now add remaining curd and cook on slow flame till the oil leaves the edges.
                            <br> 15. Meanwhile, with the remaining spices except garam masala (Turmeric Powder, Red Chili powder, Cumin powder, Coriander powder, sugar, and salt) along with 1 Tbsp. Mustard oil make a thick paste.
                            <br> 16. Add this spice paste to the pan and cook for 2 minutes.
                            <br> 17. Now add marinated chicken along with the marinade.
                            <br> 18. Mix thoroughly on low flame.
                           <br>  19. Now cook for 20 minutes on low flame and stir continuously.
                            <br> 20. Stirring is the key to make the perfect Chicken Kosha.
                            <br> 21. The chicken will release sufficient moisture while cooking which will be enough to cook the chicken.
                            <br> 22. There is no need to add extra water.
                            <br> 23. Once done, add Shahi Garam Masala to it.
                            <br> 24. After 20 minutes, the chicken will be properly cooked, the gravy will be semi-dry and will leave oil from the edges.
                            <br> 25. You must check for consistency.
                            <br> 26. Kosha Mangsho is not a dish served with excess runny gravy.
                            <br> 27. Serve it hot with your choice of Paratha, bread, roti, Pulao, or rice.

                        <p><br> Wash and rinse gobindobhog rice 3-4 times until water runs clear.
                            <br> Spread rice over a cloth, set on a strainer, to air dry for 1 hour.
                            <br> Dry roast shona moog dal on medium heat for 15 minutes. Stir constantly for even roasting. The colour of the grains will change gradually from yellow to pinkish-brown.
                            <br> Once done, wash the dal immediately with water to prevent it from cooking further. Strain and air-dry.
                            <br> Add 50 g ghee to the kadai. Let it melt. Add the cashew nuts and fry them until golden. Set aside. Fry raisins too, until plump. Set aside.
                            <br> Add 270 g more ghee to the kadai. Temper with dried red chillies, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves, and cumin seeds.
                            <br> Add ginger paste and green chilli paste. Fry for 30–40 seconds.
                            <br> Add the washed and dried gobindobhog. Fry on medium heat until rice becomes fragrant, translucent and makes a spluttering sound (about 15 minutes). Don't let it brown.
                            <br> Now add the roasted and drained shona moog, turmeric, and gorom moshla. Fry on medium heat for about 5 minutes.
                            <br> Add hot water, salt, and 2 tbsp of sugar (a little bit of sugar at this stage will prevent the rice from breaking too quickly; don't add all of it now or the rice will remain uncooked).
                            <br> Cover and steam on medium heat for 8 minutes.
                            <br> When khichuri is about 80% cooked, add dried fruits, slit green chillies, and the rest of the sugar.
                            <br> Stir very gently, and as little as possible, so the dal and rice grains don't break. Cover and steam again for 6 minutes.
                            <br> Give it a final taste and adjust seasoning accordingly.
                            <br> Turn off the heat, cover and let it rest for at least 2 hours for the best texture.

                               <br> Oil - 2-3 tbsp, mustard oil or vegetable oil
                            
                               <br>Nigella Seeds - 1 tsp
                            
                               <br>Onion - ½ cup, sliced (optional)
                            
                               <br>Turmeric - ½ tsp
                            
                               <br>Red Chilli Powder - 1 tsp<br>
                            
                            <br>Heat the oil in a wide skillet over medium heat. Add the nigella seeds and cook for 30 seconds. Add the onions and stir frequently until translucent. Add the spices - turmeric and red chili powder and mix until the water has evaporated and the oil shimmers through the spice mixture. Make sure not to let the spices burn. You may add a splash of water if needed.
                            
                           <h3> Note: I prefer onion in my Shorshe Ilish but traditionally aromatics like onion, ginger and garlic are not added. If the Ilish you bought has been frozen for a long time, you may add a teaspoon of ginger paste. Traditionally, ginger is a big no, especially when it comes to fresh fish. But outside of Bangladesh and India, Ilish can only be found frozen. Check the expiry date and try to get the freshest/newest batch of frozen fish whenever buying Ilish. Only add ginger if the fish has been frozen for too long and emanates a slight oily smell.</h3> 
                            
                            <br>Add the marinated fish pieces in a single layer to the skillet and gently sear on each side, about 1-2 minutes on each side. We are not making a crispy Ilish Bhaja here, just giving it a nice golden color before the mustard paste is added.</b>
                            
                            <br> Coconut Milk - ¼ cup (optional)
                            
                            <br>  Green Chilies - 3-5
                            
                            <br>Pour in the mustard paste and coat the fish pieces on both sides. If you find the mustard paste is slightly bitter and pungent for your liking, add a bit of coconut milk. The best way to balance out bitterness is with fat and sugar. Coconut milk is naturally sweet and high in fat, but they are considered healthy fat just an FYI. Once the fish pieces are well-coated in mustard paste (and coconut milk), add some slit green chilies and cover the lid. Turn the heat down to medium-low and simmer the fish in the mustard sauce, for 15 to 20 minutes. Check in between to make sure the bottom isn’t catching or the fish pieces aren’t burning. If the gravy is seems to dry up quickly, add a splash of water or coconut milk. Once the gravy has reached your desired consistency, turn off the heat. Serve immediately. Enjoy it with steamed rice or Panta Bhat.

                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Preheat oven to 400˚F. Place strips of bacon in a large (at least 10 inch), oven safe skillet. Cook over medium low heat on both sides until cooked through but not yet crispy, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat to a paper towel lined plate and set aside, leaving the bacon grease in the pan. When the bacon is cool enough to handle, roughly dice.
                            <br>Increase the heat to medium high, add the potatoes, bell pepper, and onion and cook for 7- 8 minutes, stirring frequently, until starting to soften and can be pierced with a fork
                            <br>Add garlic, cumin, chili powder, paprika, black pepper, and salt. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until garlic is fragrant.
                            <br>Using a spoon, create 4 to 6 holes (depending on how many eggs you want) in the hash mixture for the eggs. Distribute the cheeses evenly into each hole, and then crack one egg into each hole.
                            <br>Place in the preheat oven and cook for 8-10 minutes, until egg white is set but the yolk is still runny.
                            <br>Remove from heat. Sprinkle with cooked bacon. Garnish with fresh ground black pepper, cilantro and chives.
